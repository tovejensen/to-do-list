# To-do List Program

The To-do List program allows a user to store and retrieve tasks based on priority and time created.

## Description

This project was originally created for a school assignment and improved upon as a personal project. The user through typing input into the command line can create a new task with a given priority to be added to the to-do list, retrieve the task with the most priority and view how many tasks are in the list. If two tasks have the same priority, the more important task is determined by addition time down to the minute. The project was made in Java and is implemented using a heap priority queue.
